# AGE= 10 #int
# SHOE SIZE= 3.6 #float
name = input("please enter your name") #string
age = input("please enter your age")
print(name)
print(age)

# print(x + y)
#
# #built in method called type()
# print(type(name))
#
# #add the variable called x and the var called name
#
# #print(x + name)
# print(str(x) + name)
#
