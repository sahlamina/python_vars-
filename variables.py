#Let's create a variable

# age = input("please enter your age")
# print(name)
# print(age)

# #built in method called type()
# print(type(name))
#
# #add the variable called x and the var called name
#
# #print(x + name)
# print(str(x) + name)
#
# #above code is called casting, turning a string into an int

# create a variable called first_name and last_name
